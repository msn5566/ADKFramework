> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format or an error message if the employee is not found.
> Constraints: None.
> Logic: Retrieves employee data from the MongoDB database based on the provided employee ID.
> 
> Feature: Read Student Details
> Input: Student ID via REST API.
> Output: Student details in JSON format or an error message if the student is not found.

> Logic: Retrieves student data from the MongoDB database based on the provided student ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee details via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message or error message if the employee is not found or the update fails.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated before updating the employee.

> Output: Confirmation message or error message if the student is not found or the update fails.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated before updating the student.
> Logic: Validates input data, updates the student data in the MongoDB database based on the provided student ID.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message or error message if the employee is not found or the deletion fails.
> Constraints: None.
> Logic: Deletes employee data from the MongoDB database based on the provided employee ID.
> 
> Feature: Delete Student
> Input: Student ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message or error message if the student is not found or the deletion fails.
> Constraints: None.
> Logic: Deletes student data from the MongoDB database based on the provided student ID.
> 
> Feature: REST API
> Input: HTTP requests to various endpoints.
> Output: JSON responses representing employee/student data or error messages.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions and use `application/json` for requests and responses.
> Logic: Exposes REST endpoints for all CRUD operations on employee and student data.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Data provided for creating or updating employee/student information.
> Output: Validation success or error message indicating invalid fields.
> Constraints: Must validate all required fields and data types.
