            # Generated Spring Boot Microservice

            This project was generated using a multi-agent AI system from an SRS document.

<!-- AI-SUMMARY-START -->

## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee/Student
> Input: Employee/Student data (name, ID, etc.) via REST API (application/json).
> Output: Confirmation of successful creation with unique identifier.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: Persist employee/student data to MongoDB.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee/Student Details
> Input: Employee/Student ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee/Student details in JSON format.
> Constraints: Must return a 404 error if the ID does not exist.
> Logic: Retrieve employee/student data from MongoDB by ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee/Student Information
> Input: Employee/Student ID and updated data via REST API (application/json).
> Output: Confirmation of successful update.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: Update employee/student data in MongoDB based on ID.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee/Student
> Input: Employee/Student ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of successful deletion.
> Constraints: N/A
> Logic: Delete employee/student data from MongoDB based on ID.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: REST requests to specific URLs.
> Output: Responses in `application/json` format with appropriate HTTP status codes.
> Constraints: Endpoints must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Implement controller methods to handle REST requests and responses.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Data received from REST API requests.
> Output: Error message if validation fails.
> Constraints: Validation rules must be defined.
> Logic: Implement validation logic in the service layer.
