            # Generated Spring Boot Microservice

            This project was generated using a multi-agent AI system from an SRS document.

<!-- AI-SUMMARY-START -->

## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee details (name, email, department, etc.) in JSON format via a REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of employee creation with a unique ID, or an error message if creation fails.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. `application/json` must be used.
> Logic: The service should receive employee data via a REST endpoint, validate the data, persist it in the PostgreSQL database, and return a confirmation message with the newly created employee ID.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via a REST API endpoint.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format, or an error message if the employee ID is invalid or not found.
> Constraints: The endpoint must follow RESTful conventions. `application/json` must be used.
> Logic: The service should retrieve employee data from the PostgreSQL database based on the provided ID and return it in JSON format.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee details in JSON format via a REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of employee update, or an error message if the update fails (e.g., invalid employee ID, data validation failure).
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. The endpoint must follow RESTful conventions. `application/json` must be used.
> Logic: The service should receive the employee ID and updated data via a REST endpoint, validate the data, update the corresponding record in the PostgreSQL database, and return a confirmation message.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via a REST API endpoint.
> Output: Confirmation of employee deletion, or an error message if the deletion fails (e.g., invalid employee ID).
> Constraints: The endpoint must follow RESTful conventions. `application/json` must be used.
> Logic: The service should receive the employee ID via a REST endpoint, delete the corresponding record from the PostgreSQL database, and return a confirmation message.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests to specific endpoints.
> Output: JSON responses based on the performed operation (create, read, update, delete).
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions and use `application/json` for requests and responses.
> Logic: Expose REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee data. These endpoints should handle HTTP requests, interact with the service layer, and return appropriate JSON responses.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee data received via REST API endpoints.
> Output: Error messages if the input data is invalid based on defined validation rules.
> Constraints: Validation rules should be defined for all input fields (e.g., required fields, data type validation, format validation).
> Logic: Implement data validation logic to ensure that all input data meets the required criteria before processing. Return appropriate error messages if validation fails.
