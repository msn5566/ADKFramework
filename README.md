## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee data (name, email, department, etc.) via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of successful employee creation.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: Create a new employee record in the database.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format.
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid.
> Logic: Retrieve employee data from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee data via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of successful employee update.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. Employee ID must be valid.
> Logic: Update the employee record in the database with the provided data.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of successful employee deletion.
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid.
> Logic: Delete the employee record from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests to specific endpoints.
> Output: JSON responses with appropriate status codes.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions. Use `application/json` for all API responses and requests.
> Logic: Define and implement REST endpoints for CRUD operations.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee data.
> Output: Error messages for invalid data.
