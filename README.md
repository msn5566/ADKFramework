## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee details (name, department, salary, etc.) in JSON format via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the ID of the created employee
> Constraints: Input data must be validated
> Logic: Receive employee details, validate them, store the data in the database, and return a success message with the created employee ID.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API
> Output: Employee details in JSON format
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid
> Logic: Receive employee ID, retrieve employee details from the database based on the provided ID, and return the details in JSON format.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee details in JSON format via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message indicating successful update
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid, and input data must be validated
> Logic: Receive employee ID and updated employee details, validate the updated data, update the corresponding record in the database, and return a success message.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message indicating successful deletion
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid
> Logic: Receive employee ID, delete the corresponding record from the database, and return a success message.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: REST API requests (create, read, update, delete)
> Output: JSON responses
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions. Use `application/json` for all API responses and requests.
> Logic: Define REST endpoints for each CRUD operation, handle requests, call appropriate service layer methods, and return appropriate JSON responses.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee details (name, department, salary, etc.)
> Output: Error message if input data is invalid
> Constraints: Validation rules must be defined for each field
> Logic: Implement validation logic for each input field (e.g., name cannot be empty, salary must be a positive number), and return error messages for invalid data.
