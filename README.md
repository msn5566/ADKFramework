            # Generated Spring Boot Microservice

            This project was generated using a multi-agent AI system from an SRS document.

<!-- AI-SUMMARY-START -->

## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee details (JSON format) including name, role, and department.
> Output: Confirmation message with the new employee ID.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated before creating the employee.
> Logic: REST endpoint should accept a POST request with employee details and persist the data in the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee by ID
> Input: Employee ID
> Output: Employee details (JSON format) including name, role, and department, or an error message if the employee is not found.
> Constraints: The employee ID must be a valid ID.
> Logic: REST endpoint should accept a GET request with the employee ID and retrieve the employee data from the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee details (JSON format).
> Output: Confirmation message after successful update, or an error message if the employee is not found.
> Constraints: The employee ID must be a valid ID. Input data must be validated before updating the employee.
> Logic: REST endpoint should accept a PUT request with the employee ID and updated employee details, then update the corresponding record in the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID
> Output: Confirmation message after successful deletion, or an error message if the employee is not found.
> Constraints: The employee ID must be a valid ID.
> Logic: REST endpoint should accept a DELETE request with the employee ID and remove the employee data from the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to defined endpoints.
> Output: JSON responses with employee data or confirmation messages.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions and use `application/json` for requests and responses.
> Logic: Implement REST controllers to handle HTTP requests and interact with the service layer.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee details (JSON format) during create and update operations.
> Output: Error messages if input data is invalid, preventing the creation or update of the employee.
> Constraints: Data validation rules must be defined and enforced.
> Logic: Implement data validation logic in the service layer to check for required fields, data types, and format.
