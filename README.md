            This project was generated using a multi-agent AI system from an SRS document.

<!-- AI-SUMMARY-START -->

## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee details (name, department, etc.) in JSON format via a POST request to /employees.
> Output: Confirmation message with employee ID, and HTTP 201 Created status.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. RESTful conventions and `application/json` must be followed.
> Logic: The service should receive employee details, validate the data, and store it in the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via a GET request to /employees/{id}.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format with HTTP 200 OK status, or an error message with HTTP 404 Not Found status if the employee does not exist.
> Constraints: RESTful conventions and `application/json` must be followed.
> Logic: The service should retrieve employee details from the MongoDB database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID via a PUT request to /employees/{id} and updated employee details in JSON format.
> Output: Confirmation message with updated employee details, and HTTP 200 OK status.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. RESTful conventions and `application/json` must be followed.
> Logic: The service should receive updated employee details, validate the data, and update the corresponding record in the MongoDB database.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via a DELETE request to /employees/{id}.
> Output: Confirmation message with HTTP 204 No Content status.
> Constraints: RESTful conventions and `application/json` must be followed.
> Logic: The service should delete the employee record from the MongoDB database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests to /employees.
> Output: Responses in JSON format for CRUD operations.
> Constraints: RESTful conventions and `application/json` must be followed.
> Logic: The service should expose REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee details from any endpoint that accepts input.
> Output: Error message indicating which fields are invalid, and HTTP 400 Bad Request status.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: The service should validate all input data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
