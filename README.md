## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee details (name, ID, department, etc.) via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the new employee ID and 201 status code. Error message and appropriate error code if creation fails.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: Create a new employee record in the database.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API
> Output: Employee details in JSON format and 200 status code. Error message and 404 status code if employee not found.
> Constraints: Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Retrieve employee details from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee details via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the updated employee ID and 200 status code. Error message with the appropriate error code if update fails or employee ID does not exist.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Update the employee record in the database with the new information.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the deleted employee ID and 204 status code. Error message and appropriate error code if deletion fails or employee ID does not exist.
> Constraints: Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Delete the employee record from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Create Student
> Input: Student details (name, ID, major, etc.) via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the new student ID and 201 status code. Error message and appropriate error code if creation fails.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: Create a new student record in the database.
> 
> Feature: Read Student Details
> Input: Student ID via REST API
> Output: Student details in JSON format and 200 status code. Error message and 404 status code if student not found.
> Constraints: Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Retrieve student details from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Student Information
> Input: Student ID and updated student details via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the updated student ID and 200 status code. Error message with the appropriate error code if update fails or student ID does not exist.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Update the student record in the database with the new information.
> 
> Feature: Delete Student
> Input: Student ID via REST API
> Output: Confirmation message with the deleted student ID and 204 status code. Error message and appropriate error code if deletion fails or student ID does not exist.
> Constraints: Endpoint must be RESTful.
> Logic: Delete the student record from the database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: REST requests to the microservice.
> Output: JSON responses from the microservice.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions. Use `application/json` for all API responses and requests.
> Logic: Define REST controllers and map them to appropriate service methods.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee/Student data via REST API.
> Output: Error message if the input data is invalid.
> Constraints: All input data should be validated before processing.
> Logic: Implement validation logic in the service layer.
