## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee data (name, contact details, etc.) in JSON format via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of employee creation with a unique ID, returned as JSON.

> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format.
> Constraints: Employee ID must exist in the database.
> Logic: The service should retrieve employee details from the Mongodb database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee data in JSON format via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of employee update, returned as JSON.
> Constraints: Employee ID must exist. Input data must be validated.
> Logic: The service should update the employee record in the Mongodb database with the provided data.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation of employee deletion, returned as JSON.
> Constraints: Employee ID must exist.
> Logic: The service should delete the employee record from the Mongodb database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: API Exposure
> Input: REST API requests for CRUD operations.
> Output: Responses in `application/json` format.
> Constraints: Must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Expose REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees.
