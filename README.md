## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee data (name, job title, contact information, etc.) via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message with the newly created employee's ID.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.  Responses must be in `application/json`. Must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Persist the employee data to the PostgreSQL database.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee details in `application/json` format.
> Constraints:  Responses must be in `application/json`. Must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Retrieve employee data from the PostgreSQL database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee data via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message indicating successful update.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated. Responses must be in `application/json`. Must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Update the employee data in the PostgreSQL database for the given ID with the provided information.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message indicating successful deletion.
> Constraints:  Responses must be in `application/json`. Must follow RESTful conventions.
> Logic: Delete the employee data from the PostgreSQL database based on the provided ID.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests to specific URLs with required data.
> Output: Responses containing employee data or confirmation messages.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions and use `application/json` for requests and responses.
> Logic: Map HTTP requests to appropriate service methods and return formatted responses.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee data for creation or update operations.
> Output: Error message if validation fails, successful operation if validation passes.
> Constraints: Validation rules must be defined and enforced.
> Logic: Apply validation rules to the input data before persisting or updating employee information.
