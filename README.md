<!-- AI-SUMMARY-START -->

## üìù Project Summary

This microservice was automatically generated based on the following high-level requirements:

> Feature: Create Employee
> Input: Employee data (name, contact details, etc.) in JSON format via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message with employee ID.
> Constraints: Input data must be validated.
> Logic: The service will receive employee data, validate it, create a new employee record in the database, and return a confirmation message.
> 
> Feature: Read Employee Details
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Employee details in JSON format.
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid.
> Logic: The service will receive the employee ID, retrieve the corresponding employee record from the database, and return the details in JSON format.
> 
> Feature: Update Employee Information
> Input: Employee ID and updated employee data in JSON format via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message that the employee details have been updated.
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid. Input data must be validated.
> Logic: The service will receive the employee ID and updated data, validate the data, update the corresponding employee record in the database, and return a confirmation message.
> 
> Feature: Delete Employee
> Input: Employee ID via REST API.
> Output: Confirmation message that the employee has been deleted.
> Constraints: Employee ID must be valid.
> Logic: The service will receive the employee ID, delete the corresponding employee record from the database, and return a confirmation message.
> 
> Feature: Expose REST Endpoints
> Input: HTTP requests to defined endpoints.
> Output: JSON responses according to the request.
> Constraints: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions and use `application/json`.
> Logic: The service will define REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees, handling HTTP requests, processing data, and returning appropriate JSON responses.
> 
> Feature: Validate Input Data
> Input: Employee data received through REST APIs.
> Output: Error messages if validation fails.
> Constraints: Implement validation logic for all required fields.
> Logic: The service will implement data validation logic to ensure data integrity.
